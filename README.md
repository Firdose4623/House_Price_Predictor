# 🏡 Boston House Price Predictor

This project provides an end-to-end solution for **predicting house prices** using the **Boston Housing dataset**. It includes:

- A well-documented **Jupyter Notebook** (`Boston House Predictor.ipynb`) for data analysis and modeling
- An interactive **Streamlit app** (`streamlit_app.py`) to visualize results and make live predictions
